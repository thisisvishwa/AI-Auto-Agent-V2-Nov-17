# API Usage Report

This document provides an overview of the API usage for our Autonomous AI Agent Development project.

## OpenAI API Usage

The `openai_integration()` function in `backend/openai_integration.py` uses the OpenAI API for advanced language tasks. Here are the usage statistics:

- Total API calls: `openai_api_calls_total`
- Average response time: `openai_api_avg_response_time`
- Total data transferred: `openai_api_data_transferred`

## Palm API Usage

The `palm_api_integration()` function in `backend/palm_api_integration.py` uses the Palm API for blockchain functionality. Here are the usage statistics:

- Total API calls: `palm_api_calls_total`
- Average response time: `palm_api_avg_response_time`
- Total data transferred: `palm_api_data_transferred`

## Claude API Usage

The `claude_integration()` function in `backend/claude_integration.py` uses the Claude API for enhanced AI features. Here are the usage statistics:

- Total API calls: `claude_api_calls_total`
- Average response time: `claude_api_avg_response_time`
- Total data transferred: `claude_api_data_transferred`

## API Cost Management

We have implemented rate-limiting and cost-management strategies to control API usage and expenses. The details of these strategies are documented in `backend/openai_integration.py`, `backend/palm_api_integration.py`, and `backend/claude_integration.py`.

## Future Plans

We plan to continue monitoring our API usage closely to ensure optimal performance and cost-effectiveness. We will adjust our rate-limiting and cost-management strategies as needed based on our ongoing analysis of API usage patterns.
